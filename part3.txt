COS 432 Assignment 4: Network Security
Part 3: Penetration Testing

================================================================================

1. How many possible Wi-Fi passwords are there that fulfills the password format?

    2 * (62)^3 = 476,656
 
================================================================================

2. What is that actual Wi-Fi password used? How did you obtain that password?

    cos432-h4Z. We built a dictionary of all possible passwords fulfilling the password 
    format and then used hashcat to test each of these passwords using the 4-way handshake 
    information on Wireshark. 



================================================================================

3. There are three machines in the network, namely the employee, the firewall, and the mainframe.

a. What are their IP addresses, respectively? (If a machine has multiple interfaces, report all IP addresses.) How did you get these addresses?

    10.0.7.36, 169.254.169.254 (firewall) 
    10.0.72.245 (mainframe)
    18.223.158.90 (employee)

    We looked at packets on Wireshark. Because all data from external IP’s were passed through 10.0.7.36 and then to 10.0.72.245, 
    we inferred that these two IP’s belonged to the firewall and mainframe respectively. The employee IP’s was one of the IPs which was 
    communicating through the firewall to the mainframe. 

b. What services are currently running on these machines respectively? On which port is each service running? How did you obtain this information?

    We ran nmap port scans on ports 1-1000 for all of these machines. 

    10.0.7.36 - Firewall
    PORT    STATE SERVICE
    22/tcp  open  ssh
    80/tcp  open  http
    111/tcp open  rpcbind
    443/tcp open  https

    10.0.72.245 - Mainframe
    PORT    STATE SERVICE VERSION
    22/tcp  open  ssh     OpenSSH 7.4 (protocol 2.0)
    111/tcp open  rpcbind 2-4 (RPC #100000)
    234/tcp open  ftp     vsftpd 2.0.8 or later

    18.223.158.90 - Employee
    22/tcp  open     ssh
    25/tcp  filtered smtp
    111/tcp open     rpcbind

4. List all of the clients of the company. Briefly explain how you gained access to this client list.

    After performing our port scan using nmap in part 3, we noticed an ftp port on 10.0.72.245. 
    We used 10 minutes worth of wireshark data collected using tcpdump and filtered for ftp port and 
    noted a user bob attempting to login to the companies ftp server.  Bob’s password was unencrypted in 
    plaintext and we used these credentials to login to the ftp server on 10.0.72.245 from behind the firewall. 
    Then we navigated around and found client_list.txt in the bob/ folder within the ftp server. We transferred 
    the file to our local machine using “get” and read the file there.

5. There are unencrypted and encrypted conversations between Alice and Bob.

a. What does the unencrypted conversation say? Please paste it here and briefly describe how you found and obtained the content.

    Alice:  I heard you got a job at that terrible company...
    Bob:    Yeah. I may be sacrificing my morals and dignity, but they pay well.
    Alice:  No one will ever take you seriously again.
    Bob:    What's that? I can't hear you.
    Bob:    I'm listening to Spotify *Premium* through my *Airpods*.
    Alice:  You're disgusting. Anyway, make sure to encrypt all of our communications.
    Bob:    Of course! I found this guide that said to use a one time pad.
    Alice:  What do you think they mean by one time?
    Bob:    No idea! Hopefully nothing important.

    We used tcpdump to capture packets from both the firewall and the mainframe. We then looked at IP addresses which were communicating 
    back and forth with the mainframe through the firewall. One of these IP’s looked like it could be Bob’s device. We then used the bob.pem file 
    found in the .ssh folder to ssh into Bob’s device, where we found conversation.txt.
